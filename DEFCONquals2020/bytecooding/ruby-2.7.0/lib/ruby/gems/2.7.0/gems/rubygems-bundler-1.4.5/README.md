# Note for RubyGems >= 2.2.0

Generally, this gem is not needed on RubyGems >= 2.2.0. Simply set the `RUBYGEMS_GEMDEPS`
environment variable to either the path of your Gemfile or `-` to auto-discover in parent directories.

However, not all `Gemfile` syntax is supported yet. If you find bugs using `RUBYGEMS_GEMDEPS`, please
[report them](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues).

# rubygems-bundler && Noexec

Let's stop using `bundle exec`, kthx.

Introduction of the 1.0.0 release: http://niczsoft.com/2012/05/rubygems-bundler-integration-gem-1-0-0/

## Installation

    gem install rubygems-bundler

Next run (once):

    gem regenerate_binstubs

And you're done!

## Configuration

### ~/.gemrc

You no longer need to modify `~/.gemrc`,
just remove the old entry to be sure it works as expected.
If you need to use your own `custom_shebang`,
you can define it in `~/.gemrc` to override the default:

    custom_shebang: $env <your_custom_shebang_program>

### ./.noexec.yaml

Though you can let noexec do it's own thing and rely on looking up your binary via your Gemfile,
you can also specify which binaries you want included or excluded.
Create a .noexec.yaml file along side any Gemfiles you want to use.
Then, to enable (or disable) the usage of your particular binary into your bundle,
add an include or exclude section. For example:

```yml
exclude: [rake]
```
Or,

```yml
include: [haml]
```

### Disabling executables

In case you know certain binaries should not use `bundler` you can define a list of this binaries:

    export NOEXEC_EXCLUDE="gist bluepill"

Put it into `~/.bashrc` or other shell initialization file to make it persistent.

### Disabling any commands

In case you need explicitly skip loading `Bundler.setup`, prefix your command with `NOEXEC_DISABLE=1`:

    NOEXEC_DISABLE=1 rails new app

To disable for whole shell session:

    export NOEXEC_DISABLE=1

And to restore automatic behavior:

    unset NOEXEC_DISABLE

The old method is still available and might kick in if your tools use `NOEXEC` environment variable:

    NOEXEC=0 rails new app
    NOEXEC=skip gist

both `0` and `skip` will disable the gem, this method is deprecated and will be removed with 1.2.0.

## Problems?

Things not going the way you'd like? Try your command again with
`NOEXEC_DEBUG=1` set and create a ticket. I'll fix it right away!

### IRC support:

[#rubygems-bundler on irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#rubygems-bundler)

If you do not get an answer relatively quickly,
be sure to leave your email address so someone can get back to you later.

## How does this work (ruby_noexec_wrapper)

It modifies gem wrappers shebang to load `ruby_noexec_wrapper`.
Then, when you run gem binaries, it takes a look at your working directory,
and every directory above it until it can find a `Gemfile`.
If the executable you're running is present in your Gemfile,
it switches to using that `Gemfile` instead (via `Bundle.setup`).

Rubygems and Bundler integration makes executable wrappers
generated by rubygems aware of bundler.

rubygems-bundler was merged with [noexec gem](https://github.com/joshbuddy/noexec) in version **0.9.0**.

## Uninstallation

    gem uninstall rubygems-bundler

### Uninstallation of executable-hooks

`rubygems-bundler` does not change the shebangs itself anymore, this was extracted to `executable-hooks`:

    executable-hooks-uninstaller
    gem uninstall executable-hooks

this will set all gems to `/usr/bin/env ruby`, which is one of the safest choices (especially when using rvm).

### Removing from RVM

When using rvm, these additional steps will ensure this gem is removed and not installed again:

    rvm get stable --without-gems="rubygems-bundler executable-hooks"
    rvm all-gemsets do gem uninstall --all --executables rubygems-bundler executable-hooks
