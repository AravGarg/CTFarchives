A really good fsop writeup to learn from imo is trip to trick from hacktm ctf 2020
From teamrocketist
And of course angelboys famous paper on fsop
You flip the buffer end of stdin with the 0x30
Some bruteforcing was necessary
If my buf base had 2nd lowest byte as 0x2a
I continued
Otherwise I stopped
By flipping that byte to 0x30
You have a overflow in the stdin region
Allowing you to overwrite file structures
But you want to preserve those
However
When you hit malloc hook
Change that
To a one gadget
